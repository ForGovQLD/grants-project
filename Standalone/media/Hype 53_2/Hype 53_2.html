		<div>Internet LED: this light should be flashing green which indicates there is Internet connectivity.
</div>
		<div>Network Settings</div>
		<div>Select the buttons to learn more.</div>
		<div>Connecting to the internet</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Check WiFi</div>
		<div>Check Wi-Fi/LAN connection: where a physical ethernet cable is connected between the computer and the modem the ‘LAN’ LED should be displayed as solid green. There may be multiple ethernet cable connections at the rear of the modem (usually 4), check the corresponding LED light where the cable is plugged into. Where a Wi-Fi connection is established, there may be 2.4G or 5G LEDs on the modem that should be flashing green, which indicates successful connectivity between the computer/laptop and the modem.
</div>
		<div>ADSL/DSL: this LED should be usually flashing or solid green, which indicates a connection between the premises and the Internet Service Provider (ISP). If this light is red then it usually means there is an issue with connecting to the ISP. In this instance the ISP should be contacted for technical support.
</div>
		<div>Power LED: should be solid green, and if not check the power cord is plugged in or change the power source/power point. If no lights are lit on the modem this is an indicator that the modem or power supply is faulty.
</div>
		<div>Power LED</div>
		<div>Check modem connectivity: several indicators of whether Internet connectivity is established or not can be checked by identifying active LED lights on the modem or router. Modem LEDs may vary depending on the manufacturer although most modern-day modems have standard LED displays as shown in the example picture.
When troubleshooting Internet connectivity, check that the following LEDs on the modem are a solid green colour or flashing green (where indicated).
</div>
		<div>ADSL/DSL</div>
		<div>Network/Wi-Fi settings: most ISPS usually provide modems that are pre-configured to access their services and Internet servers. Where there is an identified issue connecting to the Internet check the connection settings by opening in the ‘Network and settings’ trouble-shooter (do this by right mouse clicking on the Wi-Fi connection in the task bar in the bottom right had corner of the screen). This will display the status of the Internet connection, and it may be necessary to contact the ISP for support where a connection can’t be established.
