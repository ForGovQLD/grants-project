		<div>Disk Defragmentation and Drive Optimisation</div>
		<div>Computer performance can be improved by completing maintenance tasks which are freely available within the operating system. The following tools are some examples of how to perform basic performance and troubleshooting tasks in Microsoft Windows. The applications shown here can be accessed by clicking on the Windows Start button and scrolling down to ‘Windows Administrative Tools’.

		<div>Confirm thatdevices are connectedthe bandwidth is the correct speed.Operating system tools allow this to be undertaken.
Maintenance can include storing or disposing of superseded components. Follow instructions described in the organisation’s guidelines or waste management policies. Ensure that disposing of components is conducted in an environmentally safe way, following the disposal techniques in the environmental waste management guidelines or policies.

</div>
		<div>Once launched the application will allow the user to select a hard disk drive that requires optimisation by removing temporary or unnecessary system or deleted files. Select which files to delete from the options provided and click on ‘Clean-up system files’. This will remove the selected files and recover hard drive space. After completing this task, the disk should be ‘defragmented’ to fully optimise the drive and enhance its performance.
</div>
		<div>The resource monitor provides useful insight where the computer appears to be running slow as it identifies CPU, Memory, Hard Disk, and Network resource utilisation that individual applications are currently using. This is a helpful when identifying where an application may need to be closed and restarted, or where a software program is causing the computer to run slowly because it is accessing a large amount of accessible CPU resources and installed memory.
</div>
		<div>Resource Monitor</div>
		<div>Disk defragmentation and drive optimisation relocates files on the drive to areas that can be more ideally accessed by the operating system. Running the tool can improve the time it takes to open files and launch programs. To access the application, locate the Windows Administrative Tools menu and then left click on the disk defragmentation icon to launch. Select the drive to defragment and then click on ‘Analyse’ and ‘Optimize’. There is also an option provided to automatically set drives to be defragmented on a scheduled basis.
