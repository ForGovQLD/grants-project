		<div>Desktop applications are often confined to a physical location and are usually installed directly on computers and laptops.

Popular applications include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Outlook. All of these applications do have consistent features, such as they need an operating system to work, and you use them by accessing features on the toolbar, usually located at the top of the page.
Depending on the application used, the toolbar may have different features, however the home toolbar (which is generally the first toolbar that appears, or accessed by clicking on 'home' at the top of the page), is the best starting point.
The home toolbar allows you to enter information, format information and save your information. There are many instructional videos on how to use these applications which are useful in helping to learn how to use them, and even to learn more advanced skills or functions available within your chosen software. Learning by using the applications regularly and looking up information on the internet can be a great way to improve your skills.
